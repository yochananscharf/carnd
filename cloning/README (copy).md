Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Project discription

Implement a PID controler.


The simulater has very sharp turns therefore the P element which defines  steering should be Proportional to the cross-track error (CTE).
Doing hard steeering will cause oscillations. The D element will fix this by steering in porportion to the CTE dirivative.
The Integral element is for fixing the bias that accumulates over time.
